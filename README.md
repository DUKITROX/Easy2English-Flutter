Easy2English Mobile App

A mobile app designed for clients of a language learning institution, with features such as visualization of their own personalized schedule, their exam results, a system for submiting homework and recieving feedback from their teachers among other things.

This app goes hand in hand with my other repo (Easy2English-python) where you would have the desktop version for the teacher's view.

Here are some screenshots of the app itself
